# Dictionnary-maker
This program takes input from a text file and sorts every word in the txt file in alphabetical order in a Sub-Dictionnary manner and creates an output file called SubDictionnary.txt
which displays these changes.
For example, if your text file has the following line: "Hello, I am a txt file." then the output file would contain the following:

SubDictionnary.txt
A
==
A
AM

F
==
FILE

H
==
HELLO

I
==
I

T
==
TEXT
